description             Gensync: a library for network syncing
long_description        Gensync is a library that uses many different syncing
                        algorithms to sync data between two nodes in a network.
                        These algorithms include IBLTs, CPISyncs, HashSyncs, 
                        Cuckoo Syncs, and more.
